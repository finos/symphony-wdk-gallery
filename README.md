# Symphony WDK Gallery

The Symphony WDK Gallery is a project collecting ready-to-use workflow templates that can be used using the Symphony Workflow Developer Kit.
Workflow templates are described using the SWADL language (https://github.com/finos/symphony-wdk/blob/master/docs/reference.md)

## Installation & Usage

1. Select the SWADL file corresponding to a template from one category under the  categories directory.
2. Copy the file to the workflow directory set in the application.yaml file in your WDK project.
3. Alternatively adapt the SWADL file to fit your own need.
