# Research Distribution 
This is a 3-step workflow where research analysts can author and submit content using a structured form, which gets sent into an approval room for review before being distributed to a list of client rooms for consumption.

Requirements:
- Set `approvalRoomId` to the stream id of the approval room
- Populate `clientRoomIds` with the list of pre-defined client room stream ids

### Run:
`/research`
